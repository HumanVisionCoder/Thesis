# Thesis
This project is about using machine learning for automatic signer diarization

In the folder models you will find the models used for this project along with the dataset if you would like to run them yourself
1. Naive Bayes
2. Logistic Regression
3. KNN
4. Decision Tree
5. Random Forest

Regarding the other files:
The order I ran the code in to generate the data is 

1.Label preparation.py
This python code generates the labels for the data

2.feature preparation.py
Extracts frames from the videos 

3.TestSizeImage.py
little bit of code to check which size of photo is still detailed enough

4.feature extraction.py
code to transform the frames generated by feature preparation.py to 1D vectors of the grayscaled frames, perform PCA, Add them to the file generated by Label preparation.py
